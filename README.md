How to setup

- git clone https://github.com/alexsomersetdesign/shopping-list-application.git
- Create Localhost evironment
- Check model/database.php to ensure correct path and credentials
- DB is included within the project files.  (DB should be empty aside a few products existing within 'products' table) and import tables NOTE: occassionally I get issues opening SQL files and running the query (my work machine is fairly old!). Importing of file resolves this issue for me.
- Ensure SMTP credentials are correct in model/user.php (line 14-20)
- Register a user and login

If there are any issues whatsoever, please do not hesitate to contact me.
